  bio: {
    tagline: "Master's in Computer Science Graduate",
    short: "Recently graduating from King's College London with first-class honours, I'm navigating the job market while chasing my passion for technology and problem-solving—wherever that curiosity leads me next.",
    personal: "That passion began long before university. As someone who is visually impaired, technology has been transformative—helping me travel, explore, and engage with the world beyond physical limits. That personal connection to assistive tech fuels my drive to craft accessible and innovative experiences for others.",
    mission: "Whether building multilingual translation tools for local councils or developing accessible healthcare products, I focus on technology that removes barriers. I believe real-world impact starts with understanding real people, and I'm looking forward to bringing that perspective into my next role."
